-- Complete the following task:

-- Create a new database called "School" this database should have two tables: teachers and students.

-- The students table should have columns for student_id, first_name,last_name, homeroom_number, phone,email, and graduation year.

-- The teachers table should have columns for teacher_id, first_name, last_name, homeroom_number, department, email, and phone.

-- The constraints are mostly up to you, but your table constraints do have to consider the following:
-- We must have a phone number to contact students in case of an emergency.

-- We must have ids as the primary key of the tables

-- Phone numbers and emails must be unique to the individual.

-- Once you've made the tables, insert a student named Mark Watney (student_id=1) who has a phone number of 777-555-1234 and doesn't have an email. He graduates in 2035 and has 5 as a homeroom number.

-- Then insert a teacher names Jonas Salk (teacher_id = 1) who as a homeroom number of 5 and is from the Biology department. His contact info is: jsalk@school.org and a phone number of 777-555-4321.
-- Solutions to Assessment
-- To create the database  simply right-click on the databases drop down menu and select "New Database".

-- Then you can use the following SQL scripts to execute the tasks:

-- To create the students table:

CREATE TABLE students(
student_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
first_name VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
last_name VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
homeroom_number integer,
phone VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
email VARCHAR(115) UNIQUE,
grad_year integer);


-- To create the teachers table:

CREATE TABLE teachers(
teacher_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
first_name VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
last_name VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
homeroom_number integer,
department VARCHAR(45),
email VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE,
phone VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE);
Then for inserting the student information:

INSERT INTO students(first_name,last_name, homeroom_number,phone,grad_year)VALUES ('Mark','Watney',5,'7755551234',2035);


-- Then for inserting the teacher information:

INSERT INTO teachers(first_name,last_name, homeroom_number,department,email,phone)VALUES ('Jonas','Salk',5,'Biology','jsalk@school.org','7755554321');
