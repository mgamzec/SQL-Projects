## ðŸ“‚ **Analyzing Website Performance**
### ðŸ“Œ **Business Concept: Analyzing Top Website Content**
Website content analysis is about **understanding which pages are seen the most by your users, to identify where to focus on improving your business.**

### ðŸ“Œ **Common Use Cases: Analyzing Top Website Content**
- Finding the most-viewed pages that customers view on your site
- Identifying the most common entry pages to your website â€“ the first thing a user sees
- For most-viewed pages and most common entry pages, understanding how those pages perform for your business objectives

### **Task**

### ðŸ“Œ **Business Concept: Landing Page Performance and Testing**
Landing page analysis and testing is about **understanding the performance of your key landing pages and then testing to improve your results**

### ðŸ“Œ **Common Use Cases: Landing Page Performance and Testing**
- Identifying your top opportunities for landing pages â€“ high volume pages with higher than expected bounce rates or low conversion rates
- Setting up A/B experiments on your live traffic to see if you can improve your bounce rates and conversion rates 
- Analyzing test results and making recommendations on which version of landing pages you should use going forward

### ðŸ“Œ **Business Concept: Analyzing and Testing Conversion Funnels**
Conversion funnel analysis is about **understanding and optimizing each step of your userâ€™s experience on their journey toward purchasing your products**

### ðŸ“Œ **Common Use Cases: Analyzing and Testing Conversion Funnels**
- Identifying the most common paths customers take before purchasing your products
- Identifying how many of your users continue on to each next step in your conversion flow, and how many users abandon at each step
- Optimizing critical pain points where users are abandoning, so that you can convert more users and sell more products

When we perform conversion funnel analysis, we will look at each step in our conversion flow to see how many customers drop off and how many continue on at each step.<br>
