## üìÇ **Analysis for Channel Management**
### üìå **Business Concept: Channel Portofolio Optimization**
Analyzing a portfolio of marketing channels is about **bidding efficiently and using data to maximize the effectiveness of your marketing budget.**

### üìå **Common Use Cases: Channel Portofolio Optimization**
- Understanding which marketing channels are driving the most sessions and orders through your website
- Understanding differences in user characteristics and conversion performance across marketing channels
- Optimizing bids and allocating marketing spend across a multi-channel portfolio to achieve maximum performance
<br>

### **Task**
### **1. Analyzing Channel Portofolios**
**Channel Portofolio Analysis** : to identify traffic coming from multiple marketing channels, we will use utm parameters stored in our sessions table

</p>
<br>

**Steps :**
- Pull weekly sessions from 22 Aug - 29 Nov for gsearch and bsearch, utm campaign nonbrand
- week_start_date | total_session | gsearch_session | bsearch_session

<br>

**Query :**
```sql
SELECT
    MIN(DATE(created_at)) AS week_start_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) AS total_session,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source = 'gsearch' THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END)  AS gsearch_session,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source = 'bsearch' THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END)  AS bsearch_session
FROM website_sessions
WHERE created_at BETWEEN '2012-08-22' AND '2012-11-29'
    AND utm_source IN ('gsearch', 'bsearch')
    AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
GROUP BY WEEK(created_at);
```

  4 ‚Äî The desktop bsearch sessions stayed at 4% of gsearch sessions but dropped after bids were lowered in weeks 2-3 of December. This drop could also be influenced by events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and other seasonal factors. For mobile sessions, there was a significant decline after bid reduction, but it varied during December, making it difficult to determine if the decline was solely due to reduced bids or other factors too.

### üìå **Business Concept: Analyzing Direct Traffic**
Analyzing your branded or direct traffic is about **keeping a pulse on how well your brand is doing with consumers, and how well your brand drives business.**

### üìå **Common Use Cases: Analyzing Direct Traffic**
- Identifying how much revenue you are  generating from direct traffic ‚Äì this is high  margin revenue without a direct cost of customer acquisition
- Understanding whether or not your paid traffic is generating a ‚Äúhalo‚Äù effect, and promoting additional direct traffic
- Assessing the impact of various initiatives on  how many customers seek out your business
